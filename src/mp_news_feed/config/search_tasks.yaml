    Search for recent news about ONE specific Member of Parliament.

    MP to search: {mp_name} from {mp_country}

    2. Alternative: "{mp_name} {mp_country} legislation"

    - Article title
    - Article URL
    - Publication date (or "Unknown" if not found)

    Aim for 3-5 relevant articles per MP. Focus on:
    - Legislative activities (bills, votes, amendments)
    - Committee work and parliamentary interventions
    - Policy statements and speeches
    - News from trusted sources (Politico, official parliament sites, quality national news)

    Skip:
    - Social media posts (unless announcing major political actions)
    - Articles about different people with the same name
    - Purely biographical or historical content
